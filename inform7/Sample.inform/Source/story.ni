"Veronica"

Neptune is a region.

Tijuana is a room.

High School is north of Tijuana. It is in Neptune.

Detective Offices is west of High School. It is in Neptune.

The player is in High School.

Instead of going from Neptune to a room which is not in Neptune:
	say "It's a bad time to leave Neptune."

Test me with "s / w / e".
