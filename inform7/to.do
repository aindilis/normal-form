(Note that we can answer questions about things by using
 the "[list of (things)]" operation.  We can therefore query

(The following phrase goes through all the directions in the compass and marks the ones that are interesting to us at the moment. We will learn more about "the room (some direction) from..." in Chapter 5, and repeating in Chapter 10.

To say grassy directions: 
    repeat with that way running through directions: 
        if the room that way from the location is a grassy room, 
            now that way is marked for listing; 
    say "[a list of directions which are marked for listing]"; 
    now every direction is not marked for listing.)
