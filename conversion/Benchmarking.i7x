A real number is a kind of value. R1 specifies a real number.
The specification of a real number is "Real numbers used for benchmark statistics. Is only minimally implemented and is not suitable for reuse."

To decide which real number is (a - number) as a real number:
	(- numtof({a}) -).

To decide which number is (a - real number) as a number:
	(- ftonumn({a}) -).

To decide which real number is (a - real number) plus (b - real number):
	(- fadd({a}, {b}) -).
To decide which real number is (a - real number) plus (b - real number) named (this is real number addition):
	decide on a plus b.

To decide which real number is (a - real number) minus (b - real number):
	(- fsub({a}, {b}) -).

To decide which real number is (a - real number) times (b - real number):
	(- fmul({a}, {b}) -).

To decide which real number is (a - real number) divided by (b - real number):
	(- fdiv({a}, {b}) -).

To decide which real number is (a - real number) rounded up:
	(- ceil({a}) -).

To decide which real number is the square root of (a - real number):
	(- sqrt({a}) -).
	
To decide which real number is (a - real number) to the power of (b - real number):
	(- pow({a}, {b}) -).

To decide which real number is the absolute value of (a - real number):
	(- fabs({a}) -).

To decide whether (a - real number) is more than (b - real number):
	(- jfgt({a}, {b}) -).

To say (a - real number):
	(- FloatDec({a}, 2); -).

Section - Test cases

A test case is a kind of thing.
The specification of a test case is "A performance test case. Must be provided with a run phrase, which is what will actually be benchmarked."

[ These properties should be set by test case authors. ]
A test case has some text called the author.
[A test case has some text called the description.]

[ Test cases must provide a run function. For a test case called "example test" the run function should be defined as follows:
	To run test one (this is run test one): ...
	The run phrase of test one is run test one. ]
A test case has a phrase nothing -> nothing called the run phrase.

[ Test cases may provide a rule to check whether VM features they need are provided. If they are not they can set the disabled property. Add rules to the initialising rules rulebook. ]
A test case can be disabled.

[ These properties are needed for the framework and should be ignored by authors. ]
A test case can be initialised.
A test case has a number called the elapsed time.
A test case has a number called the iteration time.
A test case has a number called the total time.
A test case has a number called the predicted sample count. The predicted sample count is usually 1.
A test case has a number called the iteration count.
A test case has a number called the total count.
A test case has a number called the iteration multiplier. The iteration multiplier is usually 1.
A test case has a number called the sample size.
A test case has a real number called the mean time. The mean time is usually R2139095040. [ +Infinity, so that sorting test cases works as we want, with disabled test cases last. ]
A test case has a real number called the variance.
A test case has a real number called the relative error.

Section - Low level timing functions

[ We need to know the minimum timer resolution so that our results will be meaningful. Not all terps can provide a full microsecond timer, and even those that do might might cache its value. ]
The minimum timer resolution is a number variable.
The minimum sample time is a number variable.
To calculate the minimum timer resolution:
	(- get_timer_resolution(); -).
Include (-
[ get_timer_resolution sample begin measured i;
	! Take 30 samples
	for (i=0 : i<30 : i++)
	{
		@copy current_time sp;
		@glk 352 1 0;
		do
		{
			@copy current_time2 sp;
			@glk 352 1 0;
		}
		until (current_time-->2 ~= current_time2-->2 || current_time-->1 ~= current_time2-->1);
		sample = sample
			+ (current_time2-->1 - current_time-->1) * 1000000
			+ (current_time2-->2 - current_time-->2);
	}
	(+ the minimum timer resolution +) = sample / 30;
	
	! The minimum time each test case must be run for to achieve a percent uncertainty of at most 1%.
	(+ the minimum sample time +) = (+ the minimum timer resolution +) * 50;
];
-).

[ Run a test case a certain number of times, timing the total time. ]
To time (test case - a test case) running it (iterations - a number) times/--:
	now iterations is iterations * the iteration multiplier of the test case;
	now the elapsed time of the test case is how long the run phrase of the test case takes to run iterations times;
To decide which number is how long (func - phrase nothing -> nothing) takes to run (iterations - a number) times/--:
	(- time_function({func}-->1, {iterations}) -).
Include (-
[ time_function func iterations i;
	@copy current_time2 sp;
	@copy current_time sp;
	@glk 352 1 0;
	while (i < iterations)
	{
		func();
		i++;
	}
	@glk 352 1 0;
	return (current_time2-->1 - current_time-->1) * 1000000
		+ (current_time2-->2 - current_time-->2);
];
-).

Section - Statistics

[ We must customise LIST_OF_TY_Sort in order to compare real number properties. ]
To sort (L - a list of objects) in (P - real number valued property) order:
	(- LIST_OF_TY_Sort_Real_Number_Prop({-pointer-to:L}, 1, {P}, {-block-value:P}); -).
To sort (L - a list of objects) in reverse (P - real number valued property) order:
	(- LIST_OF_TY_Sort_Real_Number_Prop({-pointer-to:L}, -1, {P}, {-block-value:P}); -).
Include (-

		for (i=1:i<no_items:i++) {
			j = random(i+1) - 1;
			v = BlkValueRead(list, LIST_ITEM_BASE+i);
			BlkValueWrite(list, LIST_ITEM_BASE+i, BlkValueRead(list, LIST_ITEM_BASE+j));
			BlkValueWrite(list, LIST_ITEM_BASE+j, v);

		return;
	}
	SetSortDomain(ListSwapEntries, ListCompareEntries);

	!else LIST_OF_TY_Sort_cf = 0;
	LIST_OF_TY_Sort_cf = fsub;
	SortArray(list, prop, dir, no_items, false, 0);
];
-).

[ T-test! ]
To decide which real number is the t value for (a - test case) and (b - test case):
	let pooled be
		( ((the sample size of a - 1) as a real number times the variance of a) plus ((the sample size of b - 1) as a real number times the variance of b) )
		divided by (the sample size of a + the sample size of b - 2) as a real number;
	decide on
		(mean time of a minus mean time of b)
		divided by the square root of ((pooled divided by the sample size of a as a real number) plus (pooled divided by the sample size of b as a real number));

[ Critical values ]
To decide which real number is the critical value for (df - number):
	(- get_critical_value({df}) -).
Include (-

	if (df > 30)
	{
		return critical_value_infinity;
	}
	return critical_values_table-->(df - 1);
];
-);

[ Significance ]
To decide whether (a - test case) and (b - test case) are statistically indistinguishable:
	[say "[fixed letter spacing]  [variable letter spacing]Variance:[the variance of a][line break]";
	say "[fixed letter spacing]  [variable letter spacing]T value:[the t value for a and b][line break]";]
	if the absolute value of (the t value for a and b) is more than the critical value for (the sample size of a + the sample size of b - 2):
		decide no;
	decide yes;

Section - Activities and rulebooks

[ We create several new activities, so that the framework can be decoupled from the interface. ]

Running the benchmark framework is an activity.
The initialising rules are a test case based rulebook.
Benchmarking something is an activity on test cases.
Timing something is an activity on test cases.

[ Go through all the test cases running them in turn. ]
Rule for running the benchmark framework (this is the main running the benchmark framework rule):
	let count be a number;
	repeat with a test case running through the list of test cases:
		follow the initialising rules for the test case;
		carry out the benchmarking activity with the test case;

[ Initialise a test case by running it once and calculating the iteration multiplier. This initial running won't be counted for the statistics, because an interpreter might need to spend extra time JITing. ]
A last initialising rule for a test case (called test case) (this is the initialising a test case rule):
	let count be 1;
	unless the test case is initialised or the test case is disabled:
		now the test case is initialised;
		[ Run the test case once in order to check it takes longer than the minimum timer resolution. Compare with three times the minimum timer resolution to ensure that we are definitely timing at least two whole resolution periods. Running only twice didn't seem enough to stop the test case from timing 0. ]
		time the test case running it count times;
		while the elapsed time of the test case < the minimum timer resolution * 3:
			[ If we're too quick, then keep doubling count until we reach the resolution. ]
			now count is count * 2;
			time the test case running it count times;
		[ From now on we will be treating this test case as if using the iteration multiplier consistutes running the test case just once, though we'll use the multiplier right at the end when we calculate the stats. ]
		now the iteration multiplier of the test case is count;

[ Benchmark a test case by timing at least 5 samples. ]
Rule for benchmarking a test case (called test case) (this is the benchmarking a test case rule):
	let sample size be a number;
	let samples be a list of real numbers;
	let period be a real number;
	let mean be a real number;
	let variance be a real number;
	let standard deviation be a real number;
	let standard mean error be a real number;
	let error margin be a real number;
	let relative error be a real number;
	if the test case is disabled:
		stop;
	now the total time of the test case is 0;
	now the total count of the test case is 0;
	[ Get 5 samples, and then keep going until we have 100 samples or we've been timing for 5 seconds. ]
	while sample size < 5 or (the total time of the test case < 5000000 and sample size < 100):
		increment sample size;
		carry out the timing activity with the test case;
		now period is
			the iteration time of the test case as a real number
			divided by (the iteration count of the test case times the iteration multiplier of the test case) as a real number;
		add period to samples;
	[ Now for our stats. Taken from benchmark.js's evaluate() ]
	now mean is (the real number addition reduction of samples) divided by sample size as a real number;
	repeat with sample running through samples:
		now variance is variance plus ((sample minus mean) to the power of 2 as a real number);
	now variance is variance divided by (sample size - 1 as a real number);
	now standard deviation is the square root of variance;
	now standard mean error is standard deviation divided by the square root of sample size as a real number;
	now error margin is standard mean error times the critical value for (sample size - 1);
	now relative error is (error margin divided by mean) times 100 as a real number;
	[ Update the test case with these stats. ]
	now the mean time of the test case is mean;
	now the variance of the test case is variance;
	now the relative error of the test case is relative error;
	now the sample size of the test case is sample size;

[ Time a test case, by running it for at least the minimum sample time. ]
Rule for timing a test case (called test case) (this is the running a test case once rule):
	let remaining time be the minimum sample time;
	let count be the predicted sample count of the test case;
	[ Reset these totals. ]
	now the iteration time of the test case is 0;
	now the iteration count of the test case is 0;
	while remaining time > 0:
		time the test case running it count times;
		[ Check for 0 times. The iteration multiplier should stop these from occuring, but just in case... ]
		if the elapsed time of the test case < 1:
			say "Error: Test time was 0!";
			next;
		increase the iteration time of the test case by the elapsed time of the test case;
		increase the total time of the test case by the elapsed time of the test case;
		increase the iteration count of the test case by count;
		increase the total count of the test case by count;
		now remaining time is the minimum sample time - the iteration time of the test case;
		[ Unless we have a positive remaining time the following calculations will be ignored. ]
		[ Estimate how long it will take to reach the minimum sample time. ]
		now count is
			(remaining time as a real number divided by (
				the elapsed time of the test case as a real number 
				divided by count as a real number)
			) rounded up
			as a number;
		[ Ensure we will run at least once more. ]
		if count < 1:
			now count is 1;
	[ Update the predicted sample count. ]
	now the predicted sample count of the test case is
		(the iteration count of the test case as a real number 
		times the minimum sample time as a real number
		divided by the iteration time of the test case) 
		rounded up 
		as a number;

---- DOCUMENTATION ---- 

Section: Introduction

Benchmarking provides a general purpose benchmarking test framework which produces statistically significant results. Benchmarking refers to carefully timing how long some task takes to run. This extension has two types of users in mind:

1. Story and extension authors can use Benchmarking to compare alternatives for some slow programming task. The example below shows how you might use Benchmarking to compare alternative ways to match texts.

2. Interpreter authors can use Benchmarking to compare their interpreter with others, as well as to compare interpreter updates to see whether they have a performance benefit or deficit.

Benchmarking is based on the Javascript library Benchmark.js. http://benchmarkjs.com

Benchmarking depends on Real-Time Delays by Erik Temple and Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold.

Unfortunately Inform 7's built in interpreter may not be modern enough to run this (this is the case at least for Windows prior to the 2012 re-release of 6G60). Please use the output.ulx file from the Build folder in another interpreter.

The latest version of this extension can always be found at http://curiousdannii.github.com/if/. To contact the author please email curiousdannii@gmail.com.

Section: Writing test cases

A test case should be added for each task or algorithm you wish to test. Each test case must be provided with a run phrase, which is what will be benchmarked. Unfortunately the Inform 7 syntax for attaching the run phrase is a little clunky. You must first give the phrase a name, and then attach it to the test case.

	My test case is a test case.
	To run my test case (this is running my test case):
		...
	The run phrase of my test case is running my test case.

If you are comparing algorithms for the same task it is important that they all do actually do the same thing. This extension does not and cannot compare whether test case algorithms are equivalent, so you should first test your algorithms thoroughly. It is also important that test cases run the same each time through, so if your test case changes the world state in some way you must reset what it changes as part of your run phrase.

Test cases are a kind of thing, so like all things they can have descriptions. They can also be given an author, as shown in the example.

Some test cases might require recent or optional interpreter features. If so then you can add an initialisation rule, in which you can check if that interpreter feature is supported, and disable the test case if not.

	To decide whether unicode is supported: (- (unicode_gestalt_ok) -).
	Rule for initialising my test case:
		unless unicode is supported:
			now my test case is disabled.

Benchmarking is currently only designed for testing Glulx functionality, and it may not work well for testing Glk functionality. If you have potential Glk test cases please contact the author.

Section: Change log

Version 1/120218: Initial (non-beta) release

Example: * Text matching - Avoiding slow Regular Expressions.

	*: "Text matching"
	
	Include Benchmarking by Dannii Willis.

	Search text is a text variable. Search text is "pineapple".
	Test text is a text variable. Test text is "apple banana grape orange pineapple starfruit".

	[ First we test what the standard rules give us. ]
	I7 default is a test case.
	The author of I7 default is "Graham Nelson".
	The description of I7 default is "The standard rules will use regular expressions to test if texts match, even though this is slow and inefficient."
	To run I7 default (this is running I7 default):
		if test text matches the text search text:
			do nothing.
	The run phrase of I7 default is running I7 default.

	[ Now check the texts directly, without using regular expressions.]
	To decide if (txb - indexed text) matches the text (ftxb - indexed text) without regex:
		(- check_for_matches({-pointer-to:txb}, {-pointer-to:ftxb}) -).
	Include (- [ check_for_matches text search   textsize searchsize i j k; textsize = BlkValueExtent(text); searchsize = BlkValueExtent(search); for (i=0 : i<textsize - searchsize + 1 : i++) { k = 0; for (j=0 : j < searchsize: j++) { if (BlkValueRead(text, i+j) ~= BlkValueRead(search, j)) { k = 1; break; } } if (k == 0) { return 1; } } return 0; ]; -).

	Direct comparison is a test case.
	The author of Direct comparison is "Dannii Willis".
	The description of Direct comparison is "We can instead check directly whether the texts match."
	To run Direct comparison (this is running Direct comparison):
		if test text matches the text search text without regex:
			do nothing.
	The run phrase of Direct comparison is running Direct comparison.
