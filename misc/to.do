(so use the inform7 action model - before any action there are checks
 that see if it can happen, etc.  Then the effects are asserted.)

(Have a continuous conditional plan for several different depths of
 the plan)

(Use this AI in other AIs like game AIs - see how it does, calibrate
 it's performance)

(develop conditional planning for the first time)

(use the planner to find conditional plans, reinvoke the planner as
 necessary (just do the initial actions for starters - have
	    response plans for most things) (call verber using RPC or
					     whatever, or UniLang, etc))

(rate failures in order of likilihood to improve planner performance)

(move planner to airgapped system for security (get another air gapped
						system - maybe Vivian should be air gapped, try to get a second
						system at least, a powerful one) )

(integrate utility maximization system here - talk about the utility of different conflicting options)

(write everything from scratch except external modules like PDDL
 planners
 (write it in Perl)
 )

(get a toy system working soon and build on it (develop a development
						path))

(integrate the suppositional reasoner and I guess life planner into
 the process)

(integrate everything here)

(Bring in enough money	
 (<REDACTED>)


 (develop day by day plan in tandem with planner - work out what needs to be done first)

 (do abstraction based planning (also have multiple levels of
				 granularity for plans))

 (<REDACTED>)
 )

(partition tasks so that there is compartmentalization of
 resources)

(resources
 (get more servers put them in computer room and upstairs)
 (get more cameras)
 
 )

(develop contingency plans
 (<REDACTED>)
 (what if the power goes out)
 (what if I am away and security is compromised.)
 (etc etc etc)
 )

(develop interactive execution manager to have responses for common actions)
(develop timeline system like Inform7 for measuring actions.
 Have it multiresolution so for instance computer programs can
 execute more actions per move.  Have say 1000 submoves per move.
 Or something.)

(develop plan to achieve this)

(<REDACTED>)
(<REDACTED>)

(use moose)

(develop plans for anticipated dilemnas, such as people ganging
up on me to prevent me from finishing this, as happened
previously)

(reward myself such as when I finish reading something, I can
 watch a movie or what not.  Find a way to package the rewards
 into discrete objects.  Like 10 minutes of watching the movie.
 Or watch the next chapter.
 (<REDACTED>))

(read book on discipline fully)

(use the Verber IEM system to build the checks into the
 activities, such as before executing a certain action, etc)

(update the WSM to have the ability to model our current
situation.  Work on updating it and logging the updates.)

(Remember, write a lot of it by hand - have to get it done.)

(have models for both RCyc and SigmaKEE as the reasoners - have
 different implementations)

(develop the execution-engine system a little further)

(try not to draw attention to myself, such as by cutting my hair,
 or writing weird things in letters.  Keep up appearances.)

(write everything as a single program for starters - worry about
 enhancing it later)



(either
 (write a PDDL planner in Perl)
 (read inform manual)
 )
